 Project Overview

Soil is the foundation of life â€” yet, it silently absorbs the impact of human activity.
In this project, I explored soil pollution data to practice and apply the fundamentals of data analysis and machine learning using Python.

I worked through each step of the data analysis process:
ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning â€” turning messy environmental data into a usable format
ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis â€” exploring how different pollutants behave and relate to each other
ðŸ”¹ Clustering with K-Means â€” 
ðŸ”¹ Visualization â€”

This project is part of my learning journey in data science, helping me strengthen my skills in data handling, visualization, and basic machine learning â€” while connecting technology to real-world environmental issues.

Technologies Used:

Python â€” Pandas - Jupyter Notebook â€” Seabornâ€”  Matplotlib â€” NumPy â€” Scikit-learn (KMeans)
